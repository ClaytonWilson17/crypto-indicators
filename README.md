# crypto-indicators

## How to use
* Create a .env file in this directory that contains the following: API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
* Make sure to replace "YOUR_KEY" with your own TAAPI.IO API key
* Run main.py to find coins with a buy indicator
* The script will take a long time to complete since we only have the free version of TAAPI.IO
